							<h1><strong>Rules</strong></h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/RulesBackground.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>[1] No stealing:</strong><br>
➥ You can only steal when you are at war with the enemy team, or as revenge.<br>

<strong>[2] No hacking or abusing glitches:</strong><br>
➥ No use of hacked clients (or hacks in general, such as chest ESP).<br>
➥ No use of exploits.<br>
➥ No use of xray.<br>
➥ In general try not to use anything that gives you an advantage over the other players!<br>

<strong>[3] Do not be excessively toxic:</strong><br>
➥ Not much to explain for this one, just try not to be very toxic in chat.<br>

<strong>[4] Do not use banned items and commands:</strong><br>
➥ List of banned items can be found in #banned-items.<br>

<strong>[5] Do not test nukes and missiles:</strong><br>
➥ Don't test any explosives in the server world.<br>
➥ Use singleplayer for testing.<br>

<strong>[6] War:</strong><br>
➥ War is a very OP scenario, and a very brutal one as well. Starting a war with another team allows the use of nukes and missiles on each other's bases. For this reason, there must be a justified reason for war and a member of staff must confirm if you can start a war or not.<br>

➥ If the war is not justified, both teams will be to carry on doing their own thing.<br>
➥ If the war is justified, and it starts, the declaring team will be tagged first, then the 2nd team.<br>

➥ Both teams do not have to agree on war, only one team can start it.<br>
➥ Reason must be good enough, and valid.<br>
<strong>[7] Raids:</strong><br>
➥ During a raid, you may not do any of the following:<br>
          - Take everything.<br>
          - Place C4 on, or around chests (it is okay if you have to toss one or two onto a door to get in).<br>
          - Purposely blow up / destroy chests.<br>
          - Mine into / out of the base.<br>
          - Building (stacking up with blocks) to get over the enemy base wall. Use the entrance to get out (or any side exits if there are any).<br>

<strong>[8] Schematica:</strong><br>
➥ Schematica and printer are both allowed!<br>

<strong>[9] Imprisonment:</strong><br>
➥ If you are imprisoned, you are to not use any commands such as /home, /tpa or /back.<br>
➥ If you are imprisoned, you or or someone else must break you out (unless the team that has captured you, decides to let you go).<br>
➥ You may only use /msg while imprisoned.<br>

➥ If you have captured a member of staff, please note that they have duties! If they go out of your cell / area of where you have them captured, they will return when they are done with their staff duties.<br>
➥ Other teams may break you out.<br>

          - You must not blow up chests.<br>
➥ You may blow up doors and windows.<br>

➥ Must have a reason to blow up their base. Either as revenge or as part of the story-line.<br>
➥ You must not blow up over 50% of their base unless at war.<br>
